## Oveview

1. Install and set up an audiobook app
1. Download the audiobook
1. Unzip the audiobook folder and move it to your audiobook directory
1. Find and play the audiobook in your audiobook app

## Install an Audiobook App

### Android

There are many audiobook apps you can choose from, but I recommend installing [Smart AudioBook Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer&hl=en_US&gl=US). The rest of the instructions are for this particular app, but you should be able to adapt them to any other audiobook app if you have another preference.

After installing you'll need to create an `Audiobooks` folder and point the app to it. From the Smart AudioBook Player app go to:
- `Library`
- \>> dot menu in the top right
- \>> `Settings`
- \>> plus folder icon
- \>> find or create a folder called `Audiobooks`
- \>> select `Use this folder`

That's the only setup necessary. From now on any folder of mp3s copied to this `Audiobook` folder will be recognized as a new audiobook.

## Download an Audiobook

Download an audiobook. If I have directed you here, ask me for a link to my audiobook library.

### Android

Pull up the link to the shared library in your Android web browser. Find the audiobook file and download it.

## Unzip and Move the Audiobook

### Android

There are many file browser apps you can choose from, but I recommend installing [Files by Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files&hl=en_US&gl=US). The rest of the instructions are for this particular app, but you should be able to adapt them to any other file browser app if you have another preference.

After installing:
1. Open the Files app
1. Navigate to `Storage devices` >> `Internal storage` >> `Download`
1. Find and select the zip file containing the audiobook files
1. Click `Extract`
1. Select `Delete ZIP file` then `Done`
1. Return to `Storage devices` >> `Internal storage` >> `Download`
1. Find the unzipped audiobook folder and click the dot menu and `Move to`
1. Select `Internal storage` >> select the `Audiobooks` folder that we created above >> `Move here`

## Play the Audiobook

### Android

Return to the Smart AudioBook Player app, navigate to the `Library` and select the refresh icon. You should see the audiobook and be able to play it from there.
